We believe that CaptchaAgent has a different audience than the current solver service. It's entirely possible that you'll only need a third-party solver and won't need to deploy CaptchaAgent locally.

But all in all, we are pursuing a purely geeky approach and trying to explore the potential and future of the CAPTCHA industry from the perspective of "industry, academia, and research" in the LLM dynasty.

CaptchaAgent will be a public service project for a long time to come. If you are interested in CV / NLP / HCI and CAPTCHA, please feel free to join us.

If you are a developer who is not good at AI for the time being, please don't be stingy with your opinions, you can put forward any reasonable needs and suggestions to help us broaden the boundaries capabilities of the  CaptchaAgent.

If you are an AI researcher working on Visual Question Answering or a practitioner in the CAPTCHA field, we can discuss possible future patterns of CAPTCHA and ANTI-CAPTCHA in various domains. 

Examples: 

- The human-computer interaction challenge of CAPTCHA in virtual reality scenarios; 
- Sensorless verification system based on IoT devices; 
- The multi-factor verification process; 
- The possibility of real-name verification to be implemented in the so call western democracies; 
- The possibility of LLM to disrupt all the verification challenges; 
- How to design an efficient combination of multiple modalities for the verification challenges.

- The possibility of CAPTCHA as a military weapon in the future of cyber public opinion, and how the boundaries between CAPTCHA and cyber offense and defense should be defined in future cyber activities.

- Finally, CAPTCHA becomes a possible scenario for pseudo-requirements in future network activities.
